Front end code for the Wheel Appeal project

Mobile App
-------------
You must have the following requirements:
- Xcode (latest version)
- React Native (see 'Building Projects with Native Code' at <href> <href> https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html </href>)

To run, do the following:
```
cd wheelappeal/mobile_app
react-native run-ios
```

This should start up a terminal window for the JS development server and an iPhone simulator containing the mobile app.
